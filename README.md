# Step 1: Create test.py
###### This file is used to test the installation of PyQt5

# Step 2: Create view.py
###### The View file represents the files, which interact with the end user. It represents the modelâ€™s data to user.

# Step 3: Create main.py
###### The aim of the main file to test the view file

# Step 4: Create model.py
###### The Model component corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with. This can represent either the data that is being transferred between the View and Controller components or any other business logic-related data.

# Step 5: Update main.py
###### Update the main file in order to test the model file also.

# Step 6: Create controller.py
###### It acts as an interface between Model and View components to process all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulate data using the Model component and interact with the Views to render the final output.

# Step 7: Update main.py
###### Update the main file in order to test the model file of the code.
